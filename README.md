This is a Rails backend API that I built for my blog page and hosted it on an Amazon EC2 Instance.

Hosting on PaaS(Platform as a Service) websites like Herouku and Render is easy but they have their own drawbacks as well e.g Hosting my APIs on Render always led to very slow load times when I used them on my frontend applications. I decided to learn how to host server-side applications on a server like AWS where you have to do manual DevOps. To set up the cloud machine to run the rails server, I had to install Ruby(3.2.2), Rails(7.0.7.2), Nodejs, and I chose to work with the SQLite Database (PostgreSQL is better for production but I kept getting authentication errors so I chose an alternative). I pointed my server to my custom subdomain (blog.andrewmuchiri.com) using NGINX and configured it to use my SSL certificate from LetsEncrypt.
